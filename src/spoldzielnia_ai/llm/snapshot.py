"""The frozen form of an ACTIVE LLM configuration revision (``llm_config_revision.snapshot``).

Written once by activation (7.1), read by every process (7.2). No secrets: keys stay on the
provider row and are decrypted when a process loads the snapshot. Deployment keys are model ids,
which the database trigger of migration 0012 relies on (``deployments -> <key> -> provider_id``).
